# Daggerheart SRD to Homebrewery

The intention of this project is to provide a simple API that returns data from the Daggerheart™ SRD, and apply a front end that transforms the JSON returned from the API calls into usable Homebrewery-flavored Markdown as a template for users to base their own creations on.
